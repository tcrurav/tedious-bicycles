# Simple Image Gallery with Flexbox + Media queries + JavaScript clicks

It's just that. A simple example on how to do a simple image gallery with Flexbox, Media queries, and the use of JavaScript click events to make a border.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Note that the JavaScript code is so tedious to just show beginners a very very simple way of doing it.

## Getting Started

Just create a new folder called "GalleryExample" for instance, and clone this project:

````
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/tediosous-bicycles.git
````

It's also important that you use the visual studio code plugin called "Live Server". Once you have installed this plugin, right click on index.html and left click on "Open with Live Server".

Enjoy!!!
